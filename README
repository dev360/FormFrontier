* A short disclaimer *
This project is mostly an experiment in abandoning ViewState and the 
provided ASP.NET Web/HTML controls. I had previously written a similar
project which utilized the madness that is WebControls - this time I
want to see how feasible it would be to rewrite similar functionality
from the ground up without using the Controls collection at all.
